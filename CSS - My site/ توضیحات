start to be like seanhalpin.io
each html element is a box.
"pesticide " is a great tool for debuggin CSS- +CTRL.
Block elements naturally get 100% width and will block others out! like p div or headings
span / img / anchor are inline element do not block other blocks out. for inline elements
we can not change width !
changing <p></p> to inline : in css: display: inline or inline-block ---> height can be change too
display : block  or inline or inline-block or none (which hide it)
visibility : hidden will arrange other like this elemnt is there but cannot be seen.
in css we have xyz and by html defult <div><h1>a<span>b</span>c</h1></div> the b will be over h1 and over div block.
Position: The position can be changed in css to neglect the defult html position which is Static - absolute relative or fixed are other positionning
by changing position: relative then top: 20px other element will stay the same because as default others are still static!
relative position: is from the natural   one and Absolute positioning is from the parrent one and also there wont be any goust there ! !
Absolute position: will take the block out of html flow. will drive absolute position for the element than other like as it was never been there!
relative and absolute position: Between relative and absolute position by default the relative one pushes the absolute one in 1 parrent unnless give the absolute one xy
Position:fix "fix" position will not change with scroll good for Nav bar
text:align:Centering everiting: body {text-align:center} make everything center without width set. and for the the text width 20% should add margin 0 auto:
margin: 0 auto; make the block centerize.
class= = = = = = =  دارد class="mosavii"
BY EDITING CSS WORK WITH ALT+TAB TO change
Border padding and margin: padding is inside of the border and the absolute ones will stay in padding zone. on the other hand, if you get some margine the border will be pushed to the block way and what is it. But the container will be all of them! it means absoulute positions will start from all container,
absolute position and the page:When I absolute-position an element inside an element, the coordinates are calculated from the edges of the container without taking into account the borders. margin-space is part of the container, although margin is out of the "borders" of our the container.
